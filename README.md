## Welcome,

**This repo is about financial modeling and application:**

* option pricing models such as Black Scholas and its extended version

*  monte carlo simulation for stock price

* time series analysis

* visualization

* Multithreading

* Web Crawling


* Root finding method such as Newton

* Machine Learning

**Packages used:**

pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn...



**Main language of Modeling**

* Linear :
A one-unit change of x corresponds to an m-unit change in y

* Log : 
diminshing returns to scale: a constant proportionate change in x is associated with the same absolute change in y

* Power: 
A one percent of change in x correpsonds to m percent change in y

* Exponential:
A one-unit of change in x corresponse to 100m% change in y
