# Main language of Modeling

## Linear : 
A one-unit change of x corresponds to an m-unit change in y
## Log : 
diminshing returns to scale: a constant proportionate change in x is associated with the same absolute change in y
## Power: 
A one percent of change in x correpsonds to m percent change in y
## Exponential : 
A one-unit of change in x corresponse to 100m% change in y
